# MYSQL Employee Tracker Created by Jeancarlos Mulet w/ ðŸ™Œ The University of Miami ðŸ™Œ

## Description

My assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, Iâ€™ll also include a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. Youâ€™ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
